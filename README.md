# c-miniprojects
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C++ mini projects that I built while learning programming. The main purpose of this repo is to practice C++ basics, problem-solving, and object-oriented programming concepts while building small but useful programs. I will keep adding more projects as I continue my learning journey.
